# Grunt Boilerplate

This is my take on a Grunt task manager. It automates Sass files, minifies css, compresses images and works with JS files.
It then puts everything nicely in a "dist" folder for use in projects.
Honestly there are probabbly better ways to do this, so change and suggest anything :)
